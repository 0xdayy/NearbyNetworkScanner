#simple nearby network scanner
#so i read more about python learned imports etc and learned how to use tkinter to make a simple gui
#the program is of course open-source and you can use it to make an advanced and better versions!
#also enjoy my comments lmao
#DONT FORGET TO INSTALL THE REQUIREMENTS USING THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE PLEASE DONT FORGOR!!!!


from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp  #here we are importing arp ether and srp from scappy (basically sum nerdy shi u dont care about)
import tkinter as tk  #here we importing tkinter so u see the fkin gui and not a damn terminal so yh ig cool
from tkinter import ttk  #more tkinter shi this getting boring but we goin to the juicy stuff


#OMG THE FUNCTION TO SCAN THE NETWORKS?!?!?!?
