This is a simple nearby network scanner. 
I studied a lil bit more python learned imports,scapy,tkinter etc and decided to use my knowledge on this simple file.
Read the comments on the .py file to get a good laugh or sum (my humour is broken).
What u should know is :

1) anyone can use this (it is open-source) to make it better and more advanced
2) it will NOT work for external networks (will work only for your lan)
3) u need sudo in linux and admin privilages on windows (ill not mine bitcoin or monero i swear)
4) AND THATS IMPORTANT. DOWNLOAD THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE (only has scapy but i felt like i hacker having that file xD)

so yh. ik noone will see those things and projects of mine but yh i like making them no joke.
Thanks for reading.
